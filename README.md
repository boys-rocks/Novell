# How to use Novell

Unlike most bots, Novell is a self-hosted bot and requires your intervention but luckily with Heroku, it can be done in few clicks.

Steps:

1. Grab yourself a discord [bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2. Create an account on [Heroku](https://herokuapp.com/)

3. Click on the Big Purple Deploy button and paste bot token in the required field.

</a>
</p>

4. [Optional] Fill Optional fields (failing to do so will result in reduced features)

5. Now invite your bot.
